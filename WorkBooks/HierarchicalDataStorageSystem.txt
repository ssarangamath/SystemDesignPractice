Hierarchical Data Storage System

Design a system to store and retrieve a hierarchical model which can store any data with the following characteristics

all nodes are under a root node, the root node doesn’t have any parent

there can be multiple root nodes

each node can have multiple child nodes

We need to design the following functionality into the system

add child node to any node

get all the children of a node, along with an indicator to show if each child node have further children or not, let’s call this the TERMINAL node indicator

You do NOT have to worry about what is exactly stored in the nodes, 

they can represent any data like confluence pages hierarchy or file system in operating systems or employee storage systems in organizations with manager-employee relationships or a heterogeneous systems that can store multiple types of nodes

> rootNode
  > node1 // '>' represents that there are more child nodes under node1
  - node2 // '-' represents that there are no further child nodes under node2
  > node3

Upon further expansion of node1
> root
  > node1
    - childNode1
  - node2
  > node3
