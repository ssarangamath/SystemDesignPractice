Few Colours

Pick Colours

- What are all colours that are to be supported by the system
- Are all the colours exposed to all the users

View Favourite Colour List of User:

Update:

- User can update means he can add new colour or remove existing colour
- Should we capture the audit

  

 Share

- Share will be separate functionality in that case.
- Lets say user updates his favorite list, then should we share the updated favourite list with the already shared folks
- Should the user be able to View the userId’s to whom he has shared the colours.
- Can the user share favorite colours to any user or only to the users that are signed up in colour picker functionality

Are we thinking about SignUp and SignIn Functionality

Non Funcional Requirements:

1. How Many Users are we looking fwd to support in the System
2. Can we assume each user to favorite all the colours in worst case

Total No Of Users: 100 M Users

  for each user : 1 Create Requests per day

  100M Requests / day

  

10^8/10^5 = 10^3 = 10 * 10^3 per second = 10,00 req/second

Favoriute List:

1Kb

100M * 365 * 5= 200* 109 = 200 GB of  Memory (Which fits into single machine)
